# swiatowid
System for comparing the scores of institution's authors in the field of
scientific publications. The data is fetched from <a href=https://pbn-ms.opi.org.pl/pbn-report-web/api/index.html>PBN's json/institution_id</a>. The final tables and plots are presented on the web.

The system is for the administrators. It needs to be installed in the given
institution. 

Many thanks to Piotr Chodnicki from https://punktacjaczasopism.pl for
converting the mnisw pdfs with journals scoring into a database. 

See <a href=http://www.inf.sgsp.edu.pl/~mimooh/swiatowid/plot.html>the demo</a>.
