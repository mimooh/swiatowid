# swiatowid
System for calculating the total score of a scientific institution in the field
of publishing and for comparing the scores of institution's authors. The data
is fetched from PBN/POL-on. The final tables and plots are presented on the web.

Many thanks to Piotr Chodnicki from https://punktacjaczasopism.pl for
converting the mnisw pdfs with journals scoring into a database. 

Demo of the running system: http://www.inf.sgsp.edu.pl/~mimooh/swiatowid/plot.html
