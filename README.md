# swiatowid
Swiatowid works on PBN https://pbn-ms.opi.org.pl data dumps. It can help with:

* inspecting what publications we have reported to https://pbn-ms.opi.org.pl
* comparing the scores of institution's publishers (plot on the web) 
* migrating from https://pbn.nauka.gov.pl/sedno-webapp/ to https://pbn-ms.opi.org.pl (needs explanation)

The system is for the administrators. It needs to be installed in the given
institution. It requires linux + python. If you want to see the plots you need php. 

Many thanks to Piotr Chodnicki from https://punktacjaczasopism.pl for
converting the mnisw pdfs with journals scoring into a database. 

See <a href=http://www.inf.sgsp.edu.pl/~mimooh/swiatowid/plot.html>the demo</a>.
